      tagline: A generic module for managing authoritative IAM bindings on Google Cloud resources.
      detailed: |
        This module provides a generic and reusable way to manage authoritative IAM bindings
        for various Google Cloud resources. It uses a map-based input to create
        `google_*_iam_binding` resources, which are authoritative and will overwrite any
        existing members for a given role on a specific resource. This approach is ideal
        for managing a complete and definitive set of members for specific roles.
        Supported resource types: project, storage_bucket, service_account.
  customization:
    variables:
      - name: bindings
        description: "A map of IAM bindings to apply, where each key is a unique name for the binding and the value is an object describing the binding's type, resource ID, role, and members."
        type: object
        default: {}
        required: false
    variableGroups:
      - name: IAM Bindings Configuration
        description: Configure the IAM bindings to be created.
        variables:
          - bindings
    outputs:
      - name: project_bindings
        description: "A map of the created project-level IAM bindings, keyed by the binding name from the input variable."
      - name: storage_bucket_bindings
        description: "A map of the created storage bucket-level IAM bindings, keyed by the binding name from the input variable."
      - name: service_account_bindings
        description: "A map of the created service account-level IAM bindings, keyed by the binding name from the input variable."
